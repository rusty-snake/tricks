There wasn't any release of kernel manual pages for nearly one year. This can be
annoing if you work with recent kernel features (like landlock for example). In
order to get more recent manula pages you can do this.

~~~ bash
wget https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/docs/man-pages/man-pages.git/snapshot/man-pages-6.0-rc1.tar.gz
tar -xvzf man-pages-6.0-rc1.tar.gz
cd man-pages-6.0-rc1
sudo make install
~~~

**Update 2022-09-26**: Use man-pages-6.0-rc1 and fix download command.
