Are you annoyed by gpg with its hundreds of command-line arguments (without subcommands),
dozens of crypto algorithms with backwards compatibility into the 1990s and different
functions in one program? Then start using [Minisign], "A dead simple tool to sign
files and verify signatures."

~~~ console
$ minisign -G
Please enter a password to protect the secret key.

Password:
Password (one more time):
Deriving a key from the password in order to encrypt the secret key... done

The secret key was saved as /home/rusty-snake/.minisign/minisign.key - Keep it secret!
The public key was saved as minisign.pub - That one can be public.

Files signed using this key pair can be verified with the following command:

minisign -Vm <file> -P RWRhTajYOf1J8t8xU/Mi3yaNxVIeLlqGKhGxzdryoqlfkveCmXDXtH4g

$ minisign -Sm checksums.txt
Password:
Deriving a key from the password and decrypting the secret key... done

$ ls
checksums.txt checksums.txt.minisig
$ minisign -Vm checksums.txt -P RWRhTajYOf1J8t8xU/Mi3yaNxVIeLlqGKhGxzdryoqlfkveCmXDXtH4g
Signature and comment signature verified
Trusted comment: timestamp:1631095330	file:checksums.txt
~~~

Voi­là that's it.
